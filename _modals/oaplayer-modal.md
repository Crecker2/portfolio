My a cappella group uses audio tracks to help us learn our music. Previously, we stored the audio files in a shared group. This became very quickly disorganized, as we needed 6 files for every song (a balanced track and one for each part) creating a long list of disorganized files and a lot of scrolling, and singers had to download files onto every device they practiced on.

The [OA Song Player](https://github.com/Crecker2/OA) was my solution to this problem. The song player loads in all 5 musical parts and adjusts volumes using the [Web Audio API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) This allows members to go to a single webpage for every part, on any device, without having to re-download the tracks over and over again.

This was my first full-scale, ground-up web application. Throughout the process, I learned not only specifics about web audio processing, but also about page construction and utilizing powerful scripting languages to solve real-world problems.
