This graphic represents the mortality reduction found during the [Summer Youth Employment Program](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/effects-youth-employment-evidence-new-york-city-summer-youth-employment-program-lotteries) in New York City. Disadvantaged students were given summer jobs, and rates of incarceration and mortality both fell.

This was my first major graphic design and data visualization experience in a professional setting. I learned how to design within the constraints of a style guide, and how to iterate edits with a design team.
