title: "'Faith' by George Michael Arrangement"
---

In my a cappella group, members can submit arrangements of songs for the group to sing. Arranging a song is more than just a transcription of the notesâ€”an arranger also has to make sure it fits the style of the group.

I arranged the [sheet music](https://joshuafayer.com/portfolio/img/Faith.pdf) with the help of Orange Appeal's music director, Brad Meader. Then, for the live performance of the song, I put together and taught the group choreography. Below is a performance of the song courtesy of the [A Cappella Council at Syracuse University.](https://www.facebook.com/suacappella/)
