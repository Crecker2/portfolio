I'm an open-sourcer at heart. I believe information deserves to be set free: easy to access, unencumbered, open to all. One area where information is particularly stressful to share is in the classroom settings&mdash;sharing and accessing studying resources, class notes, and other materials is often a confusing mess of exchanging email addresses and sharing documents between friends.

[This website](https://study.joshuafayer.com/) is my solution to that. The [github page](https://github.com/crecker2/study) comes with instructions so it's easy for anyone to make their own clone of the site. Notes are written in Markdown syntax, an easy-to-read and easy-to-learn format that makes typing up notes quick and relatively painless.

I created a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme from scratch, borrowing from a theme I'd previously created for a personal blog. The front page includes a list of sections and a feed of the 5 most recent posts. Each section page contains a group of posts, and each post is easily sharable with anchor links to jump to each section.
