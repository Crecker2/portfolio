title: Mangaged Customer Insights Booth
---

At MongoDB World 2019, I was tasked with managing the Customer Insights booth, which allowed current customers to leave feedback that was fed into a third-party peer insights platform.

To accomplish this, I staffed the booth with other interns and full-time staff, conducted training sessions, ran the booth at the conference, and conducted post-conference research to evaluate our success.

Specifically, I was tasked with learning about the peer insights program, putting together resources for interns and full-time staff (some of whom had no prior communications experience), and conducting short training sessions. At the conference, I was in charge of running the booth, assisting others when they were running the booth, managing swag and incentives for customers to fill out the survey, and other logistics.

After the conference was over, I was tasked with monitoring the progress of MongoDB's scores on the third-party platform and putting together recommendations for the booth in future conferences. These included what types of incentives would be most effective, how to improve logistics and workflow, and more.
