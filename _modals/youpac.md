I began to consider the need for an organization like YouPAC in late 2019. Young organizers are better than ever at moving public opinion on hot-button issues and getting millions to show up to support their positions. But we’re fighting on a different plane than those who oppose us; while we shape the debate, organizations like the NRA and oil lobbies are funneling millions of dollars into winning key elections all around the country. This makes even widely-supported, common-sense action nearly impossible. YouPAC brings our fight to their turf, combining young peoples’ natural talents for organizing and advocacy with more traditional political strategies like fundraising and independent advocacy.

To found YouPAC, I researched relevant tax and campaign finance laws and filed initial paperwork and subsequent regular reports with the Federal Election Commission and IRS. I built the website, [youpac.org](https://youpac.org/), from scratch and developed comprehensive policy platforms on climate change, gun control, and federal student loan reform. I created social media accounts and digital assets, organizational profiles, a business plan, and other background documents. I organized student volunteers to assist with branding and preparing for a large media and fundraising push to officially launch the organization.

YouPAC is scheduled for a complete launch in early April.
