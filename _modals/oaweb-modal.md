I created a [website](https://orangeappeal.net/) for Orange Appeal, my a cappella group at Syracuse University. This was one of my first production-grade websites, and it challenged me to come up with solutions to a handful of problems I'd never faced before. For one, the website needed to be easy to maintain, so another member of the group could take it over after I graduated. We also wanted to have a contact form on the page so people could get in touch with us. This typically requires a complicated and difficult-to-maintain back-end to process and store the user input, which wasn't ideal.

To keep the page simple and easy, I instead used a [material design CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/) to develop a front-end form that interfaces with a [Google Form](https://forms.google.com/) which stores the data using [this neat trick](https://blog.webjeda.com/google-form-customize/). This proved to be much easier to maintain, and much more useful for other members of the group.
