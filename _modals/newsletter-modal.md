title: Weekly Newsletter Writing at J-PAL North America
---

As a policy communications intern at J-PAL North America, I was responsible for conducting research on topics that might be of interest to J-PAL North America staff members and writing newsletters for each of our eight policy area. Below is a sample of a typical newsletter:
<div class="newsletterExcerpt">
	<p>Dear NA staff,</p>
	<p>This week, we’re featuring stories about a study on high college administration costs; new information showing that renewables have outpaced nuclear energy for the first time since 1984; a report that cautions that a major OB-GYN shortage may be coming to several prominent metropolitan areas; and Phoenix, Arizona’s plan to combat its summer heat waves.</p>
	<h4>Education</h4>
	<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goacta.org/publications/controlling-administrative-costs">study</a> released earlier this month by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni with research from the Institute for Higher Education Policy finds that small private universities spend as much as 64 cents on administration for every 36 cents spent on instruction. As the size of the university increases, the administrative burden decreases as it is spread out over a larger group of students—at the largest public research universities, as little as 17 cents are spent on administration for every 83 cents spent on instruction. This still represents a challenge for a majority of universities, since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/06/10/40-percent-of-u-s-colleges-enroll-fewer-than-1000-students/?utm_term=.da7ccd04101d">as many as 80 percent of United States institutions enroll fewer than 5,000 students</a> per year. Small institutions often choose to raise costs to keep up with increasing administrative burdens, instead of cutting salaries, laying off employees, or shutting down programs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/03/29/merging-colleges-to-cut-costs-and-still-boost-graduation-rates">College merges have been a solution</a> for some struggling institutions, such as several colleges in Georgia that began merging with Georgia State University in January 2016.</p>
	<h4>Energy</h4>
	<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=31932">announced earlier this month</a> that in March and April, for the first time since 1984, <a target="_blank" href="http://fortune.com/2017/07/06/renewable-energy-outpace-nuclear-power/">monthly renewable energy production has outpaced nuclear energy in the United States</a>, fueled largely by developments in wind and solar power. Though some experts predict that nuclear will still outpace renewables in yearly total energy due to seasonal variations, <a target="_blank" href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-wind-solar-costs-fall-even-faster-coal-fades-even-china-india/">Bloomberg New Energy Finance announced predictions in June</a> that by 2040, solar and wind power would make up a combined 34 percent of the world’s energy output, compared with just 12 and 5 percent today.</p>
	<h4>Health</h4>
	<p>In July, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/20/ob-gyn-shortages/">Stat News reported</a> that Doximity, a social network for U.S.-based clinicians, released <a target="_blank" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3897592-Doximity-Report-OB-GYN-Workload-and-Potential.html">information</a> suggesting that several large metropolitan areas, including Las Vegas, Orlando, and Los Angeles, will soon experience a major shortage of practicing OB-GYNs. For more than half a decade, <a target="_blank" href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2012/05/08/half-of-us-counties-have-no-ob-gyn-study">OB-GYN shortages have been making headlines</a>—in fact, nearly half of U.S. counties lack a single practicing OB-GYN. “We’ve known this shortage is coming,” said Dr. Valerie Jones, a retired OB-GYN. “But it’s worse than we actually thought.” To combat the shortage, some researchers, such as Chris Whaley, author of the Doximity study and assistant professor at the University of California-Berkeley’s School of Public Health, are exploring the use of telemedicine and financial incentives to promote more healthcare professionals entering the field.</p>
	<h4>Housing</h4>
	<p>Low-income residents who may not have access to air conditioning in homes or cars <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-phoenix-summer-heat-were-cool-trees.html">are often hit hardest by heat waves in cities like Phoenix, Arizona</a>, such as one which recently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/20/533662790/its-too-hot-for-some-planes-to-fly-in-phoenix">gained national attention by grounding planes for several hours</a>. The city has begun to search for new ways to fight the heat. Community volunteers are assisting the city government with scaling up existing heat-fighting programs, such as planting trees along streets in vulnerable neighborhoods. City officials have set goals to double the tree coverage in Phoenix to 25 percent of the city’s area by 2030. Researchers from <a target="_blank" href="https://asunow.asu.edu/content/growing-phoenixs-urban-forest-offers-cooling-potential">Arizona State University say an initiative of this scale</a> could lead to an average temperature reduction of up to 4.3 degrees Fahrenheit; for currently bare neighborhoods with no vegetation, average temperature could fall as much as 7.9 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
