title: Blog Writing at Zylotech
---

At Zylotech, I applied my experience in research and writing to turn out regular content for our company’s [blog page](https://www.zylotech.com/blog). I joined the Marketing team at a time of pivotal change, and played a part in shaping the tone and structure of our weekly editions.


Often, I would write two blog posts per week and help edit and publish posts written by other staff members from around the company. I used my experience in computer science to liaise between the product development and marketing teams to choose new topics for blog posts, and to assist other staff members during the content creation process.

Below are the published blog posts I wrote during my time there.
