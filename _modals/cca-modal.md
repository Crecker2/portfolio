In my senior year in high school, my AP U.S. Government class drafted the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2016. In May 2017, our legislation was [introduced by Representative Bobby Rush into the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1272). In August 2018, it was [introduced by Senator Doug Jones into the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3191). Since then, it has cleared both committees, and has gained the vocal support of key legislative actors across the aisle, including Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), as well as 24 cosponsors in the House of Representatives.

On the main [Cold Case Act](https://www.coldcaseact.com/) website, I helped to write content and used the [Congress Propublica API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) to build an [automatically refreshing list](https://www.coldcaseact.com/#our-supporters) of our cosponsors in Congress.

I also built from scratch a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered [press website](https://press.coldcaseact.com/), and developed content such as press releases, graphics, and a "staff" directory layout.
