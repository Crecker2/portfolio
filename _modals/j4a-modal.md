It was a serious case of right place, right time. While watching the July 31, 2019 Democratic debate, my best friend caught Joe Biden's slip-up when he told the country to "go to Joe 30330." With a quick wit and fast fingers, he was the first to buy the domain name [Joe30330.com](http://joe30330.com).

After a few minutes of brainstorming what to do with it, a suddenly obvious choice popped into our heads: [Josh for America](https://joshforamerica.com), a joking website I had built in a hurried afternoon a few months earlier, on April 1st, which launched my presidential exploratory committee.

Within 25 minutes, I had a request from USA Today in my inbox and was on the phone with Reuters. Over the next 72 hours, I did five interviews with various news organizations. Our basic website analytics measured traffic through [Joe30330.com](http://joe30330.com) peaking around 250,000 hits within the next couple of days. In talks with public relations software company Cision, I was able to compile a more holistic analysis of the aggregate scope of our efforts: 364 total stories were written (in publications including [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/31/joe-30330-debate-2020-detroit-1442909), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/joe-30330.html), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/455796-prank-campaign-launches-site-after-bidens-joe-30330-mistake), and more), which generated an estimated 6,304 social shares and 584 million global impressions and an estimated ad value equivalency of $1,135,879. Personally, my favorite article was the Huffington Post piece titled ["Debateâ€™s Biggest Winner May Have Been A Biden-Trolling Prankster"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-text-flub_n_5d425a4be4b0acb57fc72014).

Vanity metrics aside, some very real and visible impacts immediately followed the campaing: my personal SEO saw a tremendous bump, with my fake presidential campaign, personal website, twitter account, and two articles taking four of the top five spots in a Google Search for "Josh Fayer." My Twitter followers nearly tripled, owing largely to my engagement on Twitter during the 48-hour newscycle.

The next day, Joe Biden was asked if he would have done anything differently in the debate. His only response: "I would've said text."
