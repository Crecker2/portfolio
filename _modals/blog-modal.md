For a public relations course at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, I was required to launch my own blog. I opted to develop a static site loosely based off of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme I had repurposed for my [Study Site](https://fayer.me/portfolio#studysite).

I upgraded my Google Analytics suite using the [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) interface, creating a new metric that tracks the scroll depth of each page. This allows me to tell how far down each blog page the average user scrolls. This, combined with other built-in analytics, such as session duration, allow me to develop a decent sense of how well my audience engages with the content I post.
