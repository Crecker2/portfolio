The Office of Engagement Programs is an on-campus community service organization at Syracuse University. The [research report]({{'/assets/oep-research.pdf' | relative_url}}) was a product of a semester's work in a public relations research class at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.

Included in the report is an executive summary, SWOT analysis, findings from three research methods&mdash;a student survey, a focus group and a social media content analysis&mdash;as well as conclusions and recommendations to the organization.

In a subsequent class, a campaigns report was assembled acting on information gathered in the research class.
