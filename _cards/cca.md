For the past 3 years, I have assisted my former high school civics class in writing the _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act_, a bipartisan bill which seeks justice for the victims of civil rights cold cases. The bill was signed into law in January 2019. I created a press website and resources to help with media coverage, and made contributions to the main website, as well.
