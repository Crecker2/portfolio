For the past 3 years, I have assisted my former high school civics class in writing a bill and advocating its passage through Congress. The bill currently resides in the House and the Senate, where it has cleared both of its committees and awaits a floor vote. I created a press website and resources to help with media coverage, and made contributions to the main website, as well.
