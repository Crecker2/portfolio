In 2015, my former high school civics class wrote the  _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act_, a bipartisan bill which seeks justice for the victims of civil rights cold cases. The bill was signed into law in January 2019 after more than three years of lobbying. I created a press website and resources to help with media coverage, contacted reporters, and participated in interviews.
