In 2015, my former high school civics class wrote the  _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act_, a bipartisan bill which seeks justice for the victims of civil rights cold cases. The bill was signed into law in January 2019 after more than three years of lobbying. While working on the bill, I contacted reporters, participated in interviews, and created a press website to assist in media outreach efforts.
